Subject: Application for Backend / Full Stack Role

Hi [HR Name],

I came across opportunities at [Company Name] and wanted to express my interest. I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student (CGPA: 8.86) with hands-on experience building scalable backend systems and REST APIs.

Currently, I’m working on production-grade features including role-based systems and high-concurrency testing platforms. I would love to bring this experience to your team.

Please find my resume attached. Looking forward to connecting.
